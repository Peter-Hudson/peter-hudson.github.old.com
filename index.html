This is what happens when you try something new on a live website - you lose everything and everyone can see you have #Failed. 
The thing is, I had planned to use well-known static page generators with free continuous delivery platform without knowing it very well...
But since this is a busy time for me at the moment - this site isn't really going to look any better any time soon until things have settled.
I know it is sad and as a visitor you have not been rewarded for going through the effort of typing __peterhudson.name__ into the address bar.
All I can say is; "sorry." And "I really will update this soon." Where you will be rewarded for your efforts of again typing __peterhudson.name__ into the address bar. Promise.
:)
